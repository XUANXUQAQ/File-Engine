Welcome to the tutorial of File-Engine=
The default Ctrl + Alt + K calls out the search bar, which can be changed in the settings.=
You can enter the keywords you want to search here=
Let's see an example=
When you enter "test" in the search bar=
files with "test" in the name will be displayed below the search bar=
If you know multiple keywords of a file=
(for example, the file name contains both "file" and "test")=
you can separate them with ";" (semicolon) to search together as keywords.=
When entering "/test" in the search bar=
the file containing "test" in the path will be displayed below the search bar=
Add "::" + suffix after the keyword to achieve a more precise search=
The program has the following four suffixes=
not case sensitive=
"::d" is the suffix for searching only folders=
"::f" is the suffix to search only for files=
"::full" means full word matching, but case insensitive=
"::case" means case sensitive=
You can also combine different suffixes to use=
Different keywords are separated by ";" (semicolon), suffix and keywords are separated by "::" (colon)=
Click "Enter" to open the file directly=
Click "Ctrl + Enter" to open the folder where the file is located=
Click "Shift + Enter" to open the file as an administrator (use with caution)=
Click "Alt+ Enter" to copy the file path=
You can modify these hotkeys in the settings=
Enter ":" (colon) at the front of the search box to enter the command mode=
There are built-in commands, you can also add custom commands in the settings=
If you find that some files cannot be searched, you can enter ":update" in the search bar to rebuild the index.=
This is the settings window=
You can modify many settings here=
Including the color of the window, the hot key to call out the search box, the transparency of the window, custom commands and so on.=
End of the tutorial=
